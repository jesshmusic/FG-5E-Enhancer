# FG-5E-Enhancer

A community extension I'm writing to improve D&D 5E in Fantasy Grounds Unity.

## Design Goal

A rewritten minimalist streamlined version of the original 5E Combat Enhancer Classic including a number of broader ranged improvements for playing 5E, written for Fantasy Grounds Unity.

This extension is not intended for backwards compatibility with FGC. While some features may work, others may not or not as intended. There is no testing done or support for its use in FGC.

While one of the design goals is to have a small as possible footprint. This extension is very large and complex, and therefore touches on numerous functionalities.
I am not able to put extra work into making sure it is compatible with other extensions, doing so would become an endless task and the extension already does and has taken countless of hours to develop.

# Menu Options '5E Enhancer, Battle Map Settings'
- Actor health widget conditions: Enable widgets on tokens that indicate their health, such as blood skulls.
- Automatic range modifiers: Enable range messages and automatic disadvantage on long ranges.
- Blood on tokens: Draw blood marks on tokens as their health deteriorates.
- Blood pools on death: Draw blood pools underneath tokens on death.
- Horizontal health bars: Enable horizontal health bars over tokens. 5 options available: Off | Left aligned, default height | Left aligned, taller | Centered, default height | Centered, taller.
- Larger health dots: Enable larger health dots for tokens. 3 options available: FGU Default size | Larger | Largest.
- Lock token rotation to Alt + Mouse Wheel: With this enabled the tokens only rotate if you're holding down the alt button while scrolling the mouse wheel over them.
- Range rules to use: Select how to calculate ranges for automatic range modifiers. Standard, the default recommended. Actual pixel distance between the edges of the boxes surrounding the tokens divided by 5 for the width of the hexes you've set. RAW, rules as written, not tested fully.
Ranged in melee modifier (for medium sizes and smaller only): When enabled it adds a disadvantage for ranged attacks while there is an active enemy in melee range, if the attacker does not have the crossbow feat.
- Saving throw graphics: Adds saving grapical indicators for if a target succeeds of fails a saving throw. (use '/dsave' in the chat to delete these markers afterwards)
- Show faction/space underlay: Shows or hides the underlay added for tokens faction (friend/foe/neutral)
- Skipt CT actors that haven't rolled initiative: When enabled the CT will skip entries in the CT, without rolled initiatives or initiatives of 0, when the Next Actor / End Turn button is pressed.
- Skull or cross on actor death: Select the graphic to display on a token on your map when the actor drops to 0 hp's. Actor health widgets need to be enabled.
- Token deletion button combination: Select the button and mouse button combination to use for deleting tokens from the map and the CT. Added for mac users as it was easy to accidentally delete tokens with the default PC configuration.
- Token height font size: Determines the size of the fonts to use when drawing height widgets on tokens.
- Token underlay for CT active actor (DM only): Draws only the underlay of the active token on the map, clears all others. Re-add tokens to refresh. While this option is on it will remove all underlays and reach drawings for all tokens. Only the active token will get an underlay to highlight them for the DM.
- Token underlay opacity (DM only): Select the opacity of token underlays.
- Token underlay size (DM only): Select the size of the token underlay to draw.
- Use flanking rules (for medium sizes and smaller only): If enabled automatically adds the modifier you select to flanking attacks to mediums sized and smaller targets. Also considers height differences of the tokens.

# Menu Options '5E Enhancer, Window Resizing'
- New menu options that enable you to change your default window sizes for a lot of different types.

## Chat Macro Commands

- /dsave : delete save graphics from all tokens

## Features, Combat

- Add height widget to a token (DM only).
    Shift + mouse scroll on top of token.

- Active actor on CT token underlay made as toggle switches in the menu items. Clears all other underlays than the current actor.

## Features, Interface
- Content Share, allows you and your players to right click on spells, character feats, features and traits and post the descriptive text directly to the chat text by selecting the new 'Post Text in Chat' menu option at the bottom.
- New menu options in your settings, under 'Window Resizer 5E'.
    Set as default window sizes on activation. But you can enable larger windows for any or all windows from the window menu.
    Resizes windows on the fly to whatever setting you choose.
    You can return to the default window sizes at any time.
    If a window has been resized manually and is therefore in the 'windowstate.xml' file of your campaign, that takes precedence over the extension. This enables you to manually configure any windows you'd like.

## Chat Commands
/dsave : Clears save graphics from all tokens. Short for delete save/s.
